SVGPan
######

SVGPan is a a JavaScript library to zoom, drag and pan SVG
images.

Some time ago the need for a browser-compatible vectorial
language pushed me to consider the SVG markup language (I
won't say anything about Internet Explorer - it's just
unsupported there). The language itself is great, but, as
a beginner, I was so disappointed about the fact that on
the Internet I couldn't find ANY library ready to use for
panning and zooming features that I had to write one from
scratch.

The SVGPan library features:

  * Panning (pan Ã  la Google maps) (click on the white
    background and pan)

  * Zooming (using the mouse wheel)

  * Element dragging (click on a drawing element and drag
    it somewhere else)

  * Combinations of the above like zooming while dragging 

The resulting javascript library is published here, in the
hope that someone can find it useful. The library itself
is very small and easy to use; and it's licensed under the
BSD license.
